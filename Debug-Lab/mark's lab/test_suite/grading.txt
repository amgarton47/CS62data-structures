1. to get the point
   the program must compile and run
   the program must get an exception (e.g. a zero divide nor null deref)
   the exception must have occured in student code (not later in some library)

2. to get the first point
   the program must compile and run
   the program must pass an invalid or illegal argument to a call
   the program must get an exception down stream from the call (preferably in a library)

   to get the second point they must highlight the (down stack) line of code that 
      passed the illegal argument
   
3. to get any points
   the program must compile and run
   they must have set and hit a breakpoint
   screen shot must be debug-mode after having hit the breakpoint

   to get the second point they must have stopped before making a call

   to get the third point they must display the pre-call value of a variable

4. to get the first two points
   they must have continued (from step 3) to the return from the aforementioned call

   to get the third point they must be at the instruction after call

   to get the fourth point they must display the (chaged) post-call value of that variable
