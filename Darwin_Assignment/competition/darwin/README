You can run the round robin tournament with "make run"
The creatures should all be placed in the "creatures" folder and the names of the files in the "contestants.txt"
The code will run a round robin tournament based on the creatures listed in a text file
You can uncomment "WorldMap.DISPLAY = false;" in DarwinRR.java to run faster with no display
You can change the number of rounds run by changing "for (int rounds = 0; rounds < 5; rounds++)" appropriately
Before the lab I'd recommend running the code with all of the creatures using one round. Some students will have bugs or errors in their creatures.
A common error is that the program counter exceeds the number of lines. just add go 1 as the last line in their file.
