# Java Basics: Practicing Your New Java Skills

## Overview
The goals of this assignment are to give you a chance to get more comfortable with Java as a programming language as well as the new tools we'll be using (Eclipse and git).

As you program, do commit and push regularly.


## Assignment Details

The details for this assignment is a pdf that can be found [here](images/assignment_handout.pdf).


## Submitting your work

*Commit* your changes and *Push* them back to Github (see the lab assignment if you can't remember how to do this).
   
Submitting correctly is your responsibility, and if you forget to submit or submit unsuccessfully without following up, everyone will be unhappy. 

**Important:** The last commit you push by the due date is the one we will look at and grade.


## Helpful Considerations

* Saving your work - Make sure to commit and push your work to GitHub MULTIPLE TIMES throughout the process! Not only does this help us see your unique progress, but it ensures that you have frequent backups of your work. **AVOID** one big push at the end of your work.   
We want to be able to see the progressive development process that you followed.

## Grading
Your submission (in your own personal github repo) will be graded based on the following criteria:

| Criterion                                                                                        | Points |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----- |

| WarmUp: hailstorm                                                                                | 2      |
| Person                                                                                           | 3      |
| Card: getNumber                                                                                  | 1      |
| Card: isFaceup, flip                                                                             | 3      |
| [Style and formatting*](https://github.com/pomonacs622020sp/Handouts/blob/master/style_guide.md) | 1      |
| **Total**                                                                                        | **13** |

*Style and Formatting refers to the correct use of Java constructs including booleans, loop constructs, etc. Think of it as good writing style for programs.

NOTE: Code that does not compile will not be accepted! Make sure that your code compiles and runs before submitting it.

You must comment your code. We will be using the JavaDoc commenting style. To be compliant with JavaDoc, you must have the following:

   Each comment on a method or class should start with `/**` and end with `**/`. 
   Every line in between should start with a `*` and be appropriately indented. 
   (Comments on variables and constants do NOT have to use this style unless they are public.)

   A comment describing the class right before the class declaration 
   (i.e. after the `import` statements). This comment should include the `@author` tag 
   after the class description, and the `@version` tag after the author tag.

   A comment for each method describing what the method does. 
   This comment should describe the what but not the how.
   `@param`, `@return` and `@throws` tags for each method (when appropriate).

Double-check that your work is indeed pushed in Github! It is your responsibility to ensure that you do so before the deadline.
