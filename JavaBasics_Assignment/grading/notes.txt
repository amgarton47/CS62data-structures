Style:

Take off a quarter of a point for any issue, but only take it off once for the same issue

* public/private
- WarmUp: all methods should be public (unless they wrote helper methods, in which case, they should be private)
- Card: 
-- all instance variables private
-- flip/isFaceUp public
- Person
-- all instance variables private
-- all methods should be public (unless they wrote helper methods, in which case, they should be private)

* comments on all methods (they didn't have to do JavaDoc this time)

* make sure they used good variable names (most probably did)

* if/else

if they wrote:

if( some_boolean_expression ){
    return true; // or some variable
} else {
    return false; // or the negation of that variable
}

suggest they rewrite it without the if statement
