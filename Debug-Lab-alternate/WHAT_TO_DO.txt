- Talk about Eclipse debugging basics
-- Java view vs Debug view
-- setting breakpoints
-- step into, step over, step out
-- viewing variable values
-- expressions

- Run the MoveableCardDisplay class
-- You should be able to drag a card and if it's not on another card, it snaps back.  If it is on a card it swaps.
-- It doesn't do this right now

- Debug to find the error.  (The error is in the getCard method in the if statement.  We need to make sure that it's not the card that we're moving.)

- Set them loose on finding the bugs in the three matrix variations
