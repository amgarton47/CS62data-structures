If you want to add compilation errors to the .autos file (rather than
deal with them by hand later), you can:
 1. fix the testname and CLASSNAME to match the assignment
 2. edit the following failure case into student.autos
 3. increment the fail count and decrement the pass count

    "failures": [
        {
            "testname": "buildsAndRuns(CLASSNAME.Autograder)",
	    "message": "compilation errors"
        }
    ],
