This is how I broke down the points in 2019FA

Generated results (3)
	3.0 a copy of report.txt (or the sub-reports)
	2.0 no copies of reports, but data in the analysis
	1.0 some evidence that they did the runs and got results

1. sorted vs unsorted (2)

	0.5 plausible theory
	0.5 compared with data
	0.5 reasonable explanation of results
	0.5 basis (in code or data) for that explanation

2. linear vs hashed (3)

	0.5 plausible theory
	0.5 justification for that theory
	1.0 compared with data
	0.5 reasonable explanation of results
	0.5 basis (in code or data) for that explanation

3. open vs bucket (2)

	0.5 plausible theory
	0.5 compared with data
	0.5 reasonable explanation of results
	0.5 basis (in code or data) for that explanation

4. XC: open hash over-allocation (2)
	0.5 explanation of why it matters
	0.5 quantitative or algorithmic basis for that assertion
	0.5 generated data to experiment (more or less)
	0.5 reasonable discussion of results

5. XC: bucket size (2)
	0.5 explanation of why it matters
	0.5 quantitative or algorithmic basis for that assertion
	0.5 generated data to experiment (more or less)
	0.5 reasonable discussion of results
