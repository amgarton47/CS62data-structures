Migrating an Autograder.java from Junit4 to Junit5

    imports are totally different.  You probably want (at least)

    	import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;
	import org.junit.jupiter.api.BeforeEach;
	import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

    @Before	-> @BeforeEach
    @After	-> @AfterEach
    @BeforeClass -> @BeforeAll
    @AfterClass  -> @AfterAll

    The old assert*(message, other parms) are now
    	    assert*(other parms ..., message)

Changes to boilerplate

    junitmods.JSONListener implements the new listener entry points

    junitmods.JUnitJSONObject interprets the new TestExecutionResult

    <package>.PomonaRunner is very different, due to the new Discovery
    	and Launcher APIs, but the only per-project changes are, as
	before, the package and test-class names.

Changes to dependencies

    remove the junit jar, as this is now expected to be taken from
    the classpath.  By default, the run_junit and compile_and_run
    scripts try to use your Eclipse class path, if you include a
    CLASSPATH file (in the top level grading directory) that will
    be used instead.
