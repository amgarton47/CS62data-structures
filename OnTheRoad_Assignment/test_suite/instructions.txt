Instructions
- Make sure you've pulled the latest version of CS62_projects
- The unit tests are in OnTheRoad/test_suite/GradingTests.java
- You'll need to modify the constant at the top to point to the test_suite directory since it relies on some files.
- Run the unit tests
- All tests should pass.  If some fail, you'll have to see if you can figure out why.  A number of the tests are end-to-end, so there may be multiple causes (sorry!).
- Compare the output of the tests to the correct_test_output.txt
- Check for comments, style and JavaDoc (only in GraphAlgorithms and Optimizer)
